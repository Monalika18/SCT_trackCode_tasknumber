# SCT_trackCode_tasknumber1
This is a simple yet functional C++ console program that implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique. Users can encrypt or decrypt messages by applying a shift value to each character in the text.
🚀 Features
- Interactive menu to choose between encryption, decryption, or exiting
- Input validation for shift values (1–25)
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters
- Preserves non-alphabetic symbols like punctuation and spaces
- Clear prompts and clean handling of invalid inputs
🧠 How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each alphabetic character in the message by a user-defined number. For example, a shift of 3 turns A → D, B → E, and so on. Decryption reverses this operation using the same shift value.
⚙️ Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Compiler: MinGW
📚 What I Learned
This project helped me strengthen my C++ fundamentals—especially in working with conditionals, loops, input/output handling, and character manipulation. I also practiced clean code structure and logical flow for interactive user-driven programs.
📦 How to Run
- Clone the repository
- Open the project in VS Code
- Compile using MinGW (g++ filename.cpp -o cipher)
- Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions
